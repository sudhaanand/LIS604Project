<h1>Diversity, Background, & Cultures</h1>
<p>Our origin stories begin all over the world. Each culture holds its own ideals and norms for the ways its citizens behave and communicate in different settings. Based on our unique backgrounds, our styles of communication have specific differences and led to interesting virtual interactions, where we all had to be mindful of the differences in communication etiquette. We saw these, many times subtle, differences throughout our virtual interactions. Added to this is the fact that many contributors in our group have temporarily lived in other countries as well, which diversifies their communication etiquette even further. The way we interact with others is supremely influenced by not only the area we are born but the regions we further develop through educational and work experiences.</p>

<h5>United States - Communication Etiquette</h5>
	<p>Conversations often show their self-interest and this may come across as rude or aggressive. Typical conversations are more direct and simple language is valued. Non-verbal messages can be interpreted as confusing, so they are not as relied upon. Conversations are often also more personal in situations that may not call for that level of private directness.</p>

	<p>Conversations are more direct and matter-of-fact with corrections given immediately and honestly. Conversation is delivered in a more concise manner. This can sometimes be misinterpreted as being too blunt, but that is not the intent behind the direct delivery.</p>

   <h5>Finland - Communication Etiquette</h5>
	<p>Conversations are conducted in a respectful back and forth. Interrupting is considered rude and the listener is expected to let the speaker finish before contributing to the conversation. Voice tone remains moderate or neutral. Courtesy is shown to the speaker, which is an expectation that is common in all interactions.</p>
